 Proud to share my full-stack project — VibeGram 🌟
A modern social media-inspired platform built with Django and enhanced with HTMX & Alpine.js for dynamic interactivity.


🛠 Tech Stack Deep Dive:

Backend:

🐍 Python + Django – Core framework for building views, forms, authentication, and handling business logic.
🔔 Django Signals – Used to trigger automated actions (e.g., profile creation on user registration, activity logging).
📦 PostgreSQL – Production-ready relational database used for data persistence, chosen for its reliability, indexing capabilities, and JSON field support.
🧠 Custom Template Tags / Inclusion Tags – To modularize UI components like notifications and dynamic menus.
Frontend:

🎨 Tailwind CSS – Utility-first approach for rapid UI development while keeping styles maintainable and scalable.
⚡ HTMX – Enabled AJAX-like behavior without writing vanilla JS. Used for partial page updates (like comment sections, real-time likes, etc.).
🏔 Alpine.js – Lightweight reactivity layer for client-side interactions (form validation, dropdowns, modals, etc.), similar to Vue but minimal.
Media Handling:

☁ Cloudinary – For image uploads, transformations, and CDN-based delivery. Optimized image loading using responsive srcset and lazy loading techniques.

Structured Django signals smartly to avoid circular imports and keep codebase clean and scalable.
Optimized image performance by leveraging Cloudinary’s dynamic resizing and caching.
Built a custom notification system using Django ORM + HTMX to update user feeds dynamically.

💡 This project was a great deep dive into combining traditional server-rendered Django templates with modern frontend interactivity tools like HTMX and Alpine.js—proving 

Would love to hear your thoughts or any suggestions to improve it further!
